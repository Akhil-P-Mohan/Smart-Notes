# üìí Smart Notes

Smart Notes is a Flutter-based mobile application that integrates on-device AI features such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Google ML Kit. This app is designed to provide a seamless note-taking experience with text extraction from images, multilingual OCR support, and offline functionality after initial setup.

## üöÄ Setup and Build Instructions

This project requires a specific Flutter and Android build environment to work correctly. Please follow the steps carefully.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Stable on 3.32.8 (with Dart 3.8.1).
  - Using other versions may cause dependency conflicts.
- **Android Studio**: Required for Android SDK management.
- **Android SDK**: Install SDK 36 (Android 15 Preview) using Android Studio's SDK Manager.
  - Some plugins specifically require this version.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Use JDK 17.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Newer versions (like JDK 21) will cause Gradle build failures.
  - Recommended: Adoptium Temurin 17 (LTS).

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Steps

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akhil-P-Mohan/Smart-Notes.git
cd Smart-Notes
```

### Configure Gradle to Use JDK 17

This is the most critical step to prevent build crashes. Open the `android/gradle.properties` file and add the following line, replacing the path with your local JDK 17 installation path. On Windows, use double backslashes (`\\`).

```properties
# In android/gradle.properties
# This line forces Gradle to use a stable Java version.
org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Users\\YourUser\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Eclipse Adoptium\\jdk-17.0.16.8-hotspot
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Run the App

Connect a physical device or start an emulator, then run:

```bash
flutter run
```

## üî† Note on OCR Models

- This app uses Google ML Kit for on-device OCR.
- When you select a new language for the first time (e.g., Hindi, Chinese), the app will download the required recognition model via Google Play Services. This requires an internet connection for the initial download.
- ‚úÖ Once downloaded, the OCR model for that language works fully offline.

## üìå Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.32.8 (Dart 3.8.1)
- **State Management**: flutter_riverpod
- **Database**: hive / hive_flutter
- **AI/ML**: google_mlkit_text_recognition (On-device OCR)
- **Android SDK**: 36 (Android 15 Preview)
- **Java/Gradle Config**: JDK 17 & Gradle 8.9
